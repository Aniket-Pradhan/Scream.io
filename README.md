# Multiplayer-P5.js-Example

This is a short example of how one would implement multiplayer functionality into a p5.js sketch

## Setup

```bash 

# First, clone and enter the repo...
$ git clone https://github.com/samdelong/Multiplayer-P5.js-Example.git
$ cd Multiplayer-P5.js-Example

# Then, start the server and navigate to http://localhost in your browser
$ node server.js
```
Note: If you want to use this with people outside of your network, you will need to open ports 80 and 5941

## Usage

Just move your mouse around! (Requires a friend for full effect)
